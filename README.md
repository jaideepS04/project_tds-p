* Data Scraping : This project collected data on GitHub users based in Dublin with over 50 followers, including information about their repositories, by using GitHub’s API with pagination and 
  cleaning the data by removing unwanted symbols and automated rate limit handling and save a files as users.csv and repositories.csv.

* Key Insight : A surprising finding was the high number of users with only a few public repositories, which may suggest limited engagement with open-source contributions in Dublin’s developer 
  community.

* Actionable Recommendation : To enhance visibility and professional reach developers in Dublin could consider increasing their involvement in open-source projects, which may help them attract 
  more followers and improve collaboration opportunities on GitHub.
